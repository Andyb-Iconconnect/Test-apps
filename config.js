  // Free API key from https://aisstream.io (sign in with GitHub, generate a key).
  // Leave empty and the board runs in DEMO MODE with simulated movement, so you
  // can see exactly how it will look before you sign up for anything.
  //
  // WHILE THIS IS EMPTY NOTHING ON THE BOARD IS REAL. Every position, every
  // track, every figure is generated from the `demo` block in each fleet.js
  // record. The "Demo data" chip in the corner is the only thing saying so.
  //
  // Filling it in changes three things worth expecting:
  //   - Positions become real, keyed on MMSI. AIS broadcasts MMSI, never IMO,
  //     so a wrong MMSI silently tracks a stranger. The console now checks the
  //     name, IMO and size the transponder reports against each record and says
  //     so when they disagree.
  //   - Tracks start from empty. AISstream is a live stream with no history and
  //     no backfill: the board draws a trail from the moment it first hears a
  //     yacht, keeps it in this browser, and knows nothing of last week.
  //   - Gaps become normal. Terrestrial receivers reach perhaps 40 nm offshore,
  //     and a yacht crossing an ocean or running dark for the owner's privacy
  //     simply stops reporting. The board ages the last fix rather than
  //     pretending.
